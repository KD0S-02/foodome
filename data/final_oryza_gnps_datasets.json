    "description": "This data set was downloaded from MetaboLights (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/) accession number MTBLS286 Abstract:Here we investigated the dynamic metabolic changes along the rice grain development of two japonica and two indica cultivars using non-targeted metabolomics approach, in which we successfully identified 214 metabolites. Principal component and clustering analysis revealed both cultivar and developmental stage dependent metabolic changes in rice grains. Generally, the stage specific metabolic kinetics corresponded well to the physiological status of the developing grains, and some of metabolic changes in developing grain of monocot rice are common with those of dicot Arabidopsis and tomato, while others show rice specific patterns.",

The fermentation process of yamahai-ginjo-shikomi sake is mainly performed by three microbes, Aspergillus oryzae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Lactobacilli; the levels of various metabolites fluctuate during the fermentation of sake. For evaluation of the fermentation process, we monitored the concentration of moderate-sized molecules (m/z: 200-1000) dynamically changed during the fermentation process of yamahai-ginjo-shikomi Japanese sake. This analysis revealed that six compounds were the main factors with characteristic differences in the fermentation process. Among the six compounds, four were leucine- or isoleucine-containing peptides and the remaining two were predicted to be small molecules. Quantification of these compounds revealed that their quantities changed during the month of fermentation process. Our metabolomic approach revealed the dynamic changes observed in moderate-sized molecules during the fermentation process of sake, and the factors found in this analysis will be candidate molecules that indicate the progress of yamahai-ginjo-shikomi sake fermentation.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[dataset license:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)]Keywords:Oryza sativa",

    "description": "Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed beverages in the world. It contains a complex mixture of proteins from several organisms including plants (barley, hops, rice, wheat) and yeast, depending on the beer. It has been argued that fermentation of grains was responsible for our shift away from being a hunter-gatherer society, leading to social and technological advancements over thousands of years, including mass spec-based proteomics. The Proteomics Research Group (PRG) in the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities brought together an international consortium of proteomics laboratories (69 laboratories from 33 countries) to perform beer proteomics. An aliquot of specially brewed beer from the UC Davis Brewing Program was sent to 52 labs, and participants were encouraged to also use a widely available commercial beer (Heineken) and any other beer. Of the 69 laboratories that signed up for the study, 35 returned data. Of these, 32 analyzed the PRG Beer and 17 analyzed Heineken (14 analyzed both). When shipping of the PRG Beer was prohibitive, participants were encouraged to use Heineken due to its global availability and perceived quality control. Participants were also encouraged to analyze other beers of their choosing, and 79 other beers were analyzed. In total there were 357 beer injections on 13 different types of mass spectrometers around the world. In addition to helping connect scientists in trying times, we have also demonstrated the utility of multi-center studies with accessible materials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[doi:10.25345/C5GG2F]\n    \t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[dataset license:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)]Keywords:beer ; ABRF ; PRG ; Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities",

    "title": "GNPS - Reduced methane emissions in transgenic rice genotypes are associated with altered rhizosphere microbial hydrogen cycling",
    "description": "Rice paddies contribute substantially to atmospheric methane (CH4) and these emissions are expected to increase as the need to feed the human populationgrows. Here, we show that two independent rice genotypes overexpressing genes for PLANT PEPTIDES CONTAINING SULFATED TYROSINE (PSY) reduced cumulative CH4 emissions by 38% (PSY1) and 58% (PSY2) over the growth period compared with controls. Genome-resolved metatranscriptomic data from rhizosphere soils reveal lower ratios of gene activities for CH4 production versus consumption, decrease in activity of H2-producing genes, and increase in bacterial H2 oxidation pathways in the PSY genotypes. Metabolic modeling using metagenomic and metabolomic data predicts elevated levels of H2 oxidation and suppressed H2 production in the PSY rhizosphere. The H2- oxidizing bacteria have more genes for utilization of gluconeogenic acids than H2- producing counterparts, and their activities were likely stimulated by the observed enrichment of gluconeogenic acids (mostly amino acids) in PSY root exudates. Together these results suggest that decreased CH4 emission is due to the reduction of H2 available for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. The combination of rice phenotypic characterization, microbiome multi-omic analysis, and metabolic modeling described here provides a powerful strategy to discover the mechanisms by which specific plant genotypes can alter biogeochemical cycles to reduce CH4 emissions.\n\nThe work (proposal:https://doi.org/10.46936/10.25585/60008481) conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (https://ror.org/04xm1d337), a DOE Office of Science User Facility, is supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy operated under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[doi:10.25345/C57S7J46K]\n    \t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[dataset license:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)]Keywords:rice ; roots ; root exudates ; DatasetType:Metabolomics",
