    "title": "Specific Non-Gluten Proteins of Wheat are Novel Target Antigens in Celiac Disease Humoral Response",
    "description": "While the antigenic specificity and pathogenic relevance of immunologic reactivity to gluten in celiac disease have been extensively researched, the immune response to non-gluten proteins of wheat has not been characterized.  We aimed to investigate the level and molecular specificity of antibody response to wheat non-gluten proteins in celiac disease.  Serum samples from patients and controls were screened for IgG and IgA antibody reactivity to a non-gluten protein extract from the wheat cultivar Triticum aestivum 'Butte 86'.  Antibodies were further analyzed for reactivity to specific non-gluten proteins by immunoblotting, following two-dimensional gel electrophoretic separation.  Immunoreactive molecules were identified by tandem mass spectrometry.  Compared with healthy controls, patients exhibited significantly higher levels of antibody reactivity to non-gluten proteins.  The main immunoreactive non-gluten antibody target proteins were identified as serpins, purinins, \u03b1-amylase/protease inhibitors, globulins, and farinins.  Assessment of reactivity towards purified recombinant proteins further confirmed the presence of antibody response to specific antigens.  The results demonstrate that, in addition to the well-recognized immune reaction to gluten, celiac disease is associated with a robust humoral response directed at a specific subset of the non-gluten proteins of wheat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[dataset license:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)]Keywords:CELIAC DISEASE",

    "title": "A Proteomic Analysis of Grain Yield Related Traits in Wheat",
    "description": "Grain yield, which is mainly contributed by tillering capacity as well as kernel number and weight, is the most important traits to plant breeders and agronomists. Label-free quantitative proteomics was used to analyze yield-contributing organs in wheat. These were leaf sample, tiller initiation, spike initiation, ovary, and three successive kernel development stages at five, ten, and fifteen days after anthesis. We identified 3,182 proteins across all samples. The largest number was obtained for spike initiation (1673), while the smallest was kernel sample at fifteen days after anthesis (709). Of the 3,182 proteins, 296 of them were common to all seven organs. Organ-specific proteins ranged from 148 in ovary to 561 in spike initiation. When relative protein abundances were compared to that of leaf sample, 347 and 519 proteins were identified as differentially abundant in tiller initiation and spike initiation, respectively. When compared with ovary, 81, 35, and 96 proteins were identified as differentially abundant in five, ten, and fifteen days after anthesis, respectively. Our study indicated that two argonaute proteins were solely expressed in spike initiation. Of the four expansin proteins detected, three of them were mainly expressed during the first 10 days of kernel development after anthesis. We also detected cell wall invertses and sucrose and starch synthases mainly during the kernel development period. The manipulation of these proteins could lead to increases in tillers, kernels per spike, or final grain weight, and is worth exploring in future studies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[doi:10.25345/C5RS7X]\n    \t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[dataset license:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)]Keywords:wheat, grain, tiller, spikes, ovary, proteomics, mass spectrometry",

    "title": "MetaboLights MTBLS1217 - GNPS Stable Isotope\u2013Assisted Plant Metabolomics: Combination of Global and Tracer-Based Labeling for Enhanced Untargeted Profiling and Compound Annotation",
    "description": "Untargeted approaches and thus biological interpretation of metabolomics results are still hampered by the reliable assignment of the global metabolome as well as classification and (putative) identification of metabolites. In this work we present an liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based stable isotope assisted approach that combines global metabolome and tracer based isotope labeling for improved characterization of (unknown) metabolites and their classification into tracer derived submetabolomes. To this end, wheat plants were cultivated in a customized growth chamber, which was kept at 400 \u00b1 50 ppm 13CO2 to produce highly enriched uniformly 13C-labeled sample material. Additionally, native plants were grown in the greenhouse and treated with either 13C9-labeled phenylalanine (Phe) or 13C11-labeled tryptophan (Trp) to study their metabolism and biochemical pathways. After sample preparation, liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analysis and automated data evaluation, the results of the global metabolome- and tracer-labeling approaches were combined. A total of 1,729 plant metabolites were detected out of which 122 respective 58 metabolites account for the Phe- and Trp-derived submetabolomes. Besides m/z and retention time, also the total number of carbon atoms as well as those of the incorporated tracer moieties were obtained for the detected metabolite ions. With this information at hand characterization of unknown compounds was improved as the additional knowledge from the tracer approaches considerably reduced the number of plausible sum formulas and structures of the detected metabolites. Finally, the number of putative structure formulas was further reduced by isotope-assisted annotation tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) derived product ion spectra of the detected metabolites. A major innovation of this paper is the classification of the metabolites into submetabolomes which turned out to be valuable information for effective filtering of database hits based on characteristic structural subparts. This allows the generation of a final list of true plant metabolites, which can be characterized at different levels of specificity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[dataset license:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)]Keywords:GNPS Metabolomics MetaboLights",

    "description": "Proteins preform the vast majority of functions in all biological domains but their large-scale investigation has lagged behind for technological reasons. Since the first essentially complete eukaryotic proteome was reported1, advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics2 have enabled increasingly comprehensive identification and quantification of the human proteome3456. However, there are few comparisons across species, especially compared to genomics initiatives7. Here, we employ an advanced proteomics workflow, in which the peptide separation step is performed by a microstructured and extremely reproducible chromatographic system, for the in-depth measurement of 100 taxonomically diverse organisms. With two million peptide and 340,000 stringent protein identifications obtained in a standardized manner, we double the number of proteins with solid experimental evidence known to the scientific community. The data also provide a foundation for machine learning, as we demonstrate by experimentally confirming predicted peptide properties of bacteroides uniformis. Our results provide a comparative view into the functional organization of organisms across the entire evolutionary range. A remarkably high fraction of the total proteome mass in all kingdoms is dedicated to protein homeostasis and folding, highlighting the challenge of maintaining protein structure across all of life. Likewise, a constantly high fraction is involved in supplying energy resources, although the pathways range from photosynthesis through iron sulphur metabolism to carbohydrate metabolism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[dataset license:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)]Keywords:Proteomics ; mass spectrometry ; machine learning ; phylogeny ; bioinformatics ; systems biology",

    "description": "Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed beverages in the world. It contains a complex mixture of proteins from several organisms including plants (barley, hops, rice, wheat) and yeast, depending on the beer. It has been argued that fermentation of grains was responsible for our shift away from being a hunter-gatherer society, leading to social and technological advancements over thousands of years, including mass spec-based proteomics. The Proteomics Research Group (PRG) in the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities brought together an international consortium of proteomics laboratories (69 laboratories from 33 countries) to perform beer proteomics. An aliquot of specially brewed beer from the UC Davis Brewing Program was sent to 52 labs, and participants were encouraged to also use a widely available commercial beer (Heineken) and any other beer. Of the 69 laboratories that signed up for the study, 35 returned data. Of these, 32 analyzed the PRG Beer and 17 analyzed Heineken (14 analyzed both). When shipping of the PRG Beer was prohibitive, participants were encouraged to use Heineken due to its global availability and perceived quality control. Participants were also encouraged to analyze other beers of their choosing, and 79 other beers were analyzed. In total there were 357 beer injections on 13 different types of mass spectrometers around the world. In addition to helping connect scientists in trying times, we have also demonstrated the utility of multi-center studies with accessible materials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[doi:10.25345/C5GG2F]\n    \t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[dataset license:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)]Keywords:beer ; ABRF ; PRG ; Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities",

Selection tools that can be applied early in the breeding cycle are needed to accelerate genetic gain for increased wheat production while maintaining or improving grain quality if demand from human population growth is to be fulfilled. Proteomics screening assays of wheat flour can assist breeders to select the best performing breeding lines and to filter out the worst performing ones. In this study, we optimised a robust LCMS1 shotgun quantitative proteomics method to screen thousands of wheat genotypes. Using 6 cultivars and 4 replicates, we tested 3 resuspension ratios, 2 extraction buffers, 3 sets of proteases, and multiple LC settings. Protein identifications by LCMS2 was used to select the best parameters. A total 8738 wheat proteins were identified. The best method was validated on an independent set of 96 cultivars and peptides quantities were normalized using sample weights, an internal standard, and Quality Controls. Data mining tools found particularly useful to explore the flour proteome are presented.

    "title": "A community resource to mass explore the wheat grain proteome and its application to the late-maturity alpha-amylase problem.",
    "description": "Late maturity alpha amylase is a wheat genetic defect causing the synthesis of high isoelectric point alpha amylase in the aleurone as a result of a temperature shock during mid grain development or prolonged cold throughout grain development leading to an unacceptable low falling numbers at harvest or during storage. High pI alpha amylase is normally not synthesized until after maturity in seeds when they may sprout in response to rain or germinate following sowing the next season crop. Whilst the physiology is well understood, the biochemical mechanisms involved in grain LMA response remain unclear. We have employed high throughput proteomics to analyse thousands of wheat flours displaying a range of LMA values. We have applied an array of statistical analyses to select LMA responsive biomarkers and we have mined them using a suite of tools applicable to wheat proteins. To our knowledge, this is not only the first proteomics study tackling the wheat LMA issue but also the largest plant based proteomics study published to date. Logistics, technicalities, requirements, and bottlenecks of such an ambitious experiment are discussed. We observed that stored LMA affected grains activated their primary metabolisms such as glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle, along with DNA and RNA binding mechanisms, as well as protein translation. This logically transitioned to protein folding activities driven by chaperones and protein disulfide isomerase, as well as protein assembly via dimerisation and complexing. The secondary metabolism was also mobilised with the up regulation of phytohormones, chemical and defense responses. LMA further invoked cellular structures among which ribosomes, microtubules, and chromatin. Finally, and unsurprisingly, LMA expression greatly impacted grain starch and other carbohydrates with the up regulation of alpha gliadins and starch metabolism, while LMW glutenin, stachyose, sucrose, UDP galactose and UDP glucose were down regulated. This work demonstrates that proteomics deserves to be part of the wheat LMA molecular toolkit and should be adopted by LMA scientists and breeders in the future.\nDOI: 10.1093/gigascience/giad084\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[doi:10.25345/C53N20J8S]\n    \t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[dataset license:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)]Keywords:bottom-up shotgun proteomics ; late maturity alpha-amylase LMA ; statistics ; data mining",

    "description": "Plant-based adhesives, such as the ones made from wheat, have been prominently used for books and paper-based objects and are also used as conservation adhesives. Starch paste originates from starch granules, whereas flour paste encompasses the entire wheat endosperm proteome, offering strong adhesive properties due to gluten proteins. From the conservation perspective, understanding the precise nature of the adhesive is vital, as the longevity, resilience, and reaction to environmental changes can differ substantially between starch and flour-based pastes. We devised a proteomics method to discern the protein content of these pastes. Protocols involved extracting soluble proteins using 0.5 M NaCl and 30 mM Tris-HCl solutions, then targeting insoluble proteins, such as gliadins and glutenins, with a buffer containing 7M urea, 2M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mM Tris, and 75 mM DTT. Flour paste's proteome is diverse (1942 proteins across 759 groups), contrasting with starch paste's predominant starch-associated protein makeup (218 proteins in 58 groups). Transformation into pastes reduces proteomes' complexity. Testing on historical bookbindings confirmed the use of flour-based glue, rich in gluten and serpins. High levels of deamidation were detected, particularly for glutamine residues, which can impact the solubility and stability of the glue over time. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[doi:10.25345/C5J679702]\n    \t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[dataset license:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)]Keywords:wheat ; starch ; flour ; collagen ; leather",
