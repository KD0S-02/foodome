    "description": "Here we investigate how the effector molecule HC-toxin, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, produced by Cochliobolus carbonum promotes pathogen virulence in maize through altering protein acetylation. Using mass spectrometry we globally quantified the abundance of 3,636 proteins and 2,791 acetylation sites in maize plants treated with HC-toxin as well as HC-toxin deficient or producing strains of C. carbonum. Analysis of these data demonstrates that acetylation is a widespread post-translational modification impacting proteins encoded by many intensively studied maize genes. Furthermore, the application of exogenous HC-toxin enabled us to show that the activity of plant-encoded enzymes can be modulated to alter acetylation of non-histone proteins during an immune response. Collectively, these results provide a resource for further mechanistic studies examining the regulation of protein function and offer insight into the complex immune response triggered by virulent C. carbonum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[dataset license:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)]Keywords:Acetylome ; plant defense ; immunity ; mass spectrometry ; proteomics",

    "description": "Glyphosate tolerant genetically modified (GM) maize NK603 was assessed as substantially equivalent to its isogenic counterpart by a nutrient composition analysis in order to be granted market approval. We have applied contemporary in depth molecular profiling methods of NK603 maize kernels (sprayed or unsprayed with Roundup) and the isogenic corn to reassess its substantial equivalence status. Proteome profiles of the maize kernels revealed alterations in the levels of enzymes of glycolysis and TCA cycle pathways, which were reflective of an imbalance in energy metabolism. Changes in proteins and metabolites of glutathione metabolism were indicative of increased oxidative stress. The most pronounced metabolome differences between NK603 and its isogenic counterpart consisted of an increase in polyamines including N-acetyl-cadaverine (2.9-fold), N-acetylputrescine (1.8-fold), putrescine (2.7-fold) and cadaverine (28-fold), which depending on context can be either protective or a cause of toxicity. Our molecular profiling results show that NK603 and its isogenic control are not substantially equivalent. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[dataset license:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)]Keywords:maize",

To understand maize (Zea mays) antibiotics imparting disease resistance we integrated large-scale transcriptomic patterns, association mapping, enzyme assays, proteomics, structure elucidation and targeted mutagenesis. Three zealexin (Zx) gene clusters (GC) comprised of 4 sesquiterpene synthases (GC1:Zx1-4) and 6 cytochrome P450s in the Cyp71Z (GC2:Zx5-7) and Cyp81E (GC3:Zx8-10) families drive the production diverse antibiotic cocktails. Gene duplications ensure pathway resiliency to single null mutations while promiscuous enzymes constitute a biosynthetic hourglass pathway acting on diverse endogenous substrates to drive additional antibiotic complexity. Zx pathway activation mediating pathogen resistance occurs during a dramatic reorganization of >50% of the measurable proteome. Understanding the genetic basis of specialized metabolic pathways structured to maintain disease resistance provides a conceptual foundation for transferring durable biochemical immunity between plants.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[doi:10.25345/C5ND42]\n    \t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[dataset license:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)]Keywords:maize (Zea mays) disease resistance ; zealexin ; metabolic pathways",

    "description": "The evolution of maize yields under drought is of particular concern in the context of climate change and human population growth. To better understand the mechanisms associated with the genetic polymorphisms underlying the variations of traits related to drought tolerance, we used a systems genetics approach integrating high-throughput phenotypic, proteomics and genomics data acquired on 254 maize hybrids grown under two watering conditions. We show that the genetic architecture of protein abundances depends on protein function and that water deficit strongly remodeled the proteome and induced a reprogramming of the genetic control of the abundances of proteins involved in drought and stress response. These findings bring several lines of evidence supporting candidate genes at many loci and provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[doi:10.25345/C57D8V]\n    \t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[dataset license:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)]Keywords:proteomics, GWAS, drought, Zea mays, mass spectrometry, integrative biology",

    "description": "Plants defend themselves against herbivores by activating a plethora of genetic and biochemical mechanisms aimed at reducing plant damage and insect survival. The short-term plant response to insect attack is well understood, but less is known about the maintenance of this response over time. We performed transcriptomic and metabolomics analyses in order to identify genes and metabolites involved in the long-term response of maize to attack by the corn borer Sesamina nonagrioides. To determine the role of elicitors present in caterpillar secretions, we also evaluated the response of maize stem challenged with insect regurgitates. The integrative analysis of the omics results revealed that the long-term response in maize is characterized by repression of the primary metabolism and a strong redox response, mainly mediated by germin-like proteins to produce anti-nutritive and toxic compounds that reduce insect viability, and with the glutathione\u2013ascorbate cycle being crucial to minimize the adverse effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the plant. Our results suggest that different defense mechanisms are involved in the long-term response compared to those reported during the early response. We also observed a marginal effect of the caterpillar regurgitates on the long-term defensive response.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[dataset license:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)]Keywords:GNPS Metabolomics MetaboLights",

Profiles of the proteome of maize leaves revealed hybrid-specific differences in the chloroplast and mitochondria; levels of their energy transduction complexes and ribosomes were selectively elevated 10-20% above mid-parent levels. Each of these protein machines is comprised of nuclear-encoded and organelle-encoded subunits and we refer to them as digenomic protein complexes. Expression heterosis of the organelle ribosome proteins was quantitatively predictive of growth heterosis in a set of hybrids. Ethylene biosynthetic enzyme levels were reduced in hybrids and an ethylene biosynthesis mutant in an inbred background partially phenocopied the molecular differences seen in hybrids indicating that reduced ethylene levels may play a role in maize heterosis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[doi:10.25345/C5NX7C]\n    \t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[dataset license:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)]Keywords:heterosis ; quantitative proteomics ; digenomic complex ; organelle ribosome",

    "description": "Root growth in maize (Zea mays L.) is regulated by the activity of the quiescent center (QC) stem cells located within the root apical meristem. Here we show that despite being highly hypoxic under normal oxygen tension, QC stem cells are vulnerable to hypoxic stress which causes their degradation with the subsequent inhibition of root growth. Under low oxygen, QC stem cells become depleted of starch and soluble sugars, and exhibit reliance on glycolytic fermentation with the impairment of the TCA cycle through the depressed activity of several enzymes including pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH).\n\nCorn root sample pools from three genotypes were subjected to differential protein analysis using TMT10 isotopic labelling. Run S1 contained three biological replicates of each genotype under baseline condition, while run S2 contained three biological replicates of each genotype under a low oxygen stress condition. The final TMT channel in both runs contained a baseline pool across all genotypes to serve as a cross-run expression anchor. Each set was a 2D-LC-MS2 run with 10 fractions of 90 minutes each.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[doi:10.25345/C5Q52FP58]\n    \t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[dataset license:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)]Keywords:TMT10 ; corn ; stress response",

    "description": "The 15 strains of Gambierdiscus were cultivated in four separate laboratories. Each laboratory grew their available strains (see sample metadata) in addition to the G. australes strain AUS S080911_1 isolated from Pacific Ocean.\n\nIrradiance (70-100 umol photons m-2 s-1) and light/dark cycle (12h:12h) were standardized between the different laboratories, the other cultivation parameters were defined by each laboratory considering optimal growth parameters and technical requirements.\n\nSamples were extracted twice in methanol 90% from freeze-dried cell pellets (2mL per million of cells). The extraction cycle was as follows: vortex 30 s, ultrasonic bath (25 kHz on ice, 15 min), vortex 30 s and centrifugation (4 000 g, 2 min). The extracts resulting from the two extraction cycles were pooled into an amber glass vial and stored at -80 C (final concentration : 250,000 cells mL-1).\n\nMetabolomic profiles were acquired by Ultra-high-performance Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). The instrumentation consisted of a UHPLC system (1290 Infinity II, Agilent) coupled to a quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer (QTOF 6550, Agilent) equipped with a Dual Jet Stream electrospray ionization (ESI) interface. The analytical column was a core-shell Kinetex C18 (100 x 2.1 mm, 1.7 um, Phenomenex) with a suited guard column. Mobile phases consisted of water (A) and acetonitrile/water (95:5, V:V) (B), both containing 2 mM ammonium formate and 50 mM formic acid The flow rate was 0.4 mL min-1 and the injection volume was 5 uL. The following elution gradient was used: 5% B (0-1 min), 5-100% B (1-11 min), 100% B (11-13 min), 5% B (13-18 min).\n\nMass spectra were recorded in both positive and negative full-scan modes from m/z 100 to 1700 at a mass resolving power of 25 000 full-width at half-maximum (fwhm, m/z = 922.0099) and an acquisition rate of 2 spectra/s.\n\nAuto-MS/MS was performed iteratively: each sample was injected 5 times in ESI+ mode and the ions fragmented were manually excluded from the following analyses\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[doi:10.25345/C55T3G985]\n    \t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\t[dataset license:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)]Keywords:marine toxins, ciguatera, gambierones, maitotoxins",
